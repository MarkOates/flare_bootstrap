# FlareBootstrap

FlareBootstrap is a set of project templates to get started with AllegroFlare. Project templates include:

2. an empty **AllegroFlare** project
3. an empty **AllegroFlare**+**FlareGUI** project
4. an empty **AllegroFlare**+**FlareGUI** project that implements the **3D graphics pipeline**.
1. an empty "vanilla Allegro" project that is *only* Allegro 5.

Also included is a `Makefile` that will build all of the projects out of the box.
